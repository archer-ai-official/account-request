# Account request

Hey there! I found your account on GitHub when trying to register the archer-ai account name and see that you haven't had much activity here. I'd like to ask if you'd be willing to let me use this account name. If not I respect that and won't bother you again.

I work at a big tech company and am setting up a software dev social media profile across several different sites with the archer-ai account name. GitHub doesn't allow buying/selling of usernames, but if you're getting into tech I could meet with you to give career guidance and/or resume review. I do this regularly as volunteer work for college students who want to work in the tech industry.

Hope you are having a good week and thanks for your consideration! Feel free to contact me at archer <at> archer-ai.ai.
